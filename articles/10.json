  "shortDescription": "This 'deepfake' video starring Jordan Peele as Barack Obama shows how easy it's getting to create convincing audio and video fakes.",
  "longDescription": "The ObamaPeele video was created using another emerging technology: FakeApp. Itâ€™s a free tool thatâ€™s recently been used to insert the faces of celebrities into porn videos. Part of the process for creating this video involved taking an original video of Barack Obama and pasting Jordan Peeleâ€™s mouth into it. It looked really bad and clumsy at first. But things got remarkably better the longer FakeApp was left to process a more believable amalgamation of Obamaâ€™s head and Peeleâ€™s mouth. That took roughly 56 hours and was overseen by a video effects professional. More details at: https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/obama-jordan-peele-deepfake-video-debunk-buzzfeed"
