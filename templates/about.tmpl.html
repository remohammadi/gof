        <p>
        ‘Fake news’: to Donald Trump, it’s a well-loved catch-all phrase for the mainstream
        news media, but to scholars and politicians, it’s a trend of great concern.
        Fake news, and dis-, mis-, and mal-information is becoming harder for the average
        media consumer to detect and harder still for news media organizations to combat.
        In this project, we ask media consumers to challenge their ability to judge the
        authenticity of videos through our Game of Fakes; an interactive web-based game.
        We also investigate further steps to use this game to find answer to the questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How does awareness of disinformation and disinformation debunking affect the level of trust people place in news media? And, </li>
          <li>How does awareness of disinformation and disinformation debunking affect a person’s trust in his or her own ability to discern and identify authentic news media?</li>
